# Personalised-Music-Recommedner-System

### Abstract

This project includes the creation of a personalized playlist recommendation system utilizing the Spotify Million Song Dataset, which resulted in a significant boost in user engagement. It enhanced music recommendations by 30%, achieved a 0.92 F1-score, and reduced user churn by 15% through a hybrid approach integrating ANNOY, knowledge-based graphs, deep neural networks, and density-based clustering. Additionally, the system executed a hybrid content-based recommendation strategy, achieving 98% playlist accuracy with User Collaborative Filtering.
